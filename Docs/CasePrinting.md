First, [work out which board](WhatBoardDoIHave.md) you have.

Go to [the Thingiverse entry](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1656531) for the cases and download the correct version
for the board you have.

You now have several options:
- Print it yourself
- Take your STL and send it to someone from 3DHubs.

Regardless of what you choose, make sure to follow the print settings listed
on the Thingiverse listing.

Most importantly, ensure that you print the cases in the orientation that they've
been rendered at - small side down for the case, and clip side down for the rear
cover.

My cases are printed in PLA but ABS should work fine.

## Installing the PCB
Simply slide the PCB into the open back of the case. Depending on your tolerances,
this may be a tight fit. Don't panic! It's designed to be locked in so it doesn't
come out when inserting it into the USB port.
**Make sure the reset switch doesn't get caught on the rear opening.** The
switch itself is quite fragile and will easily pop off if you are too violent.

Once the board is snapped in, insert the rear cover. It's designed to bend, so
expect a nice snug fit. **If you are using V4** this won't be quite flush with the
back of the case. This is due to a PCB design oversight when I made the V4 board.

*If you have any issues with a self-printed case, please don't hesitate to contact me!*
